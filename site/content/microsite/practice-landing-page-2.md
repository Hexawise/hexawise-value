intro_header: About Us
intro_body: "We launched in 2009 with one goal: to help software testing teams
  quickly design objectively better tests. We believe that designing the right
  tests is an absolutely crucial (yet frequently overlooked) component of the
  testing process. Hexawise has quickly become the world’s leading test design
  tool. The value of Hexawise is largest when Systems Under Test are complex and
  the financial risk of defects in production are high. It is no surprise, then,
  that the majority of Hexawise’s clients are Banks, Capital Markets firms, and
  Insurance firms."
